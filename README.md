# 🩺 Doctor Listing Page

## 🚀 Task Overview

This project is a **doctor listing web page** that allows users to:

- Search doctors by name using an **autocomplete search bar**.
- Filter doctors based on **consultation type**, **specialties**, and **sort options**.
- View a dynamically updated list of doctors using data from a **public API**.

> 📝 Note: All functionality works entirely on the **client side**, after the initial API fetch.
